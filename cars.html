As time</p>			<p>passed, BMW M began to supplement BMW's vehicle portfolio with specially modified higher trim models,</p>			<p>for which they are now most known by the general public. These M-badged cars traditionally include</p>			<p>modified engines, transmissions, suspensions, interior trims, aerodynamics, and exterior modifications</p>			<p>to set them apart from their counterparts. All M models are tested and tuned at BMW's private facility</p>			<p>at the <em>Nurburgring</em> racing circuit in Germany. On September 25, 2013, BMW released the the technical</p>			<p>specifications of the M4. It is powered by the S55B30 engine, which is developed and engineered</p>			<p>by <em>BMW M GmbH</em>. This 3.0-litre inline-6 engine has been built specifically for the new M4/M3, having</p>			<p>a redline of 7,600 rpm with the rev limiter coming of 7,300 rpm. The engine uses two mono-scroll turbochargers</p>			<p>with a peak boost pressure of 18.1 psi (1.2 bar). The power is rated at 317 kW (431 PS; 425 hp), however this</p>			<p>is achieved not at a specific engine speed, but is instead rated throughout the range of 5,500-7,300 rpm.</p>		</article><!-- end of article -->	</div><!-- end of div element -->		</section><!-- end of section calss car-amg --><footer class="back-wheel">	<div>	<p>Copyright &copy; 2020 Ernesto L Zanabria, All Rights Reserved.
