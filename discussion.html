Javascript runs on browser</p>		<p>and connects to proxy API. Single page aplications are stored an authorization <code>token</code></p>		<p>in <code>window.localStorage</code> so when you need it, it can be retrieved when sending an</p>		<p> API request. Unfortunately <code>window.localStorage</code> was never designed to be secure.</p>		<p>Which any piece of JavaScript can read and write from/to it, which makes it vulnerable.</p>		<h2>Protecting against XSS</h2>		<p>In JavaScript applications, an XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attack is one of the most maliciousattacks.</p>		<p>Browsers offer and implement several features to help prevent those vulnerabilities. A security</p>		<p>header is HTTP Response Header designed for security purposes.</p>				<h3>Content Security Policy (CSP)</h3>		<p>The CSP header describe a series of directives (or rules) to instruct the browser to allow or block</p>		<p>resources to be loaded and executed. <code>Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; ...directives</code></p>				<h4>Subresource Integrity (SRI)</h4>		<p>If an attacker is able to modify the e.g. <code>jquery.min.js</code> file content that is store on a CDN,</p>		<p>our application will still oad the file but it doesn't know the content changed an it might contain</p>		<p>malicious code. In order to prevent that, we can use another important security feature: Subresource Integrity.</p>		<p>Using SRI enables the browser to verify that file. This is how you hash the file 		<code><span>'script src="https://cdnjs.../3.3.1/jquery.min.js" integrity="sha256-FgpCb/KJQ1LfOu91ta32o/NMZxltwRo8QtmkMRdAu8=" crossorigin="anonymous" /script'</span></code></p>		<p>Content-Security-Policy is a powerful feature with a lot of options and flexibility to instruct the browser</p>		<p>to understand the context of our application or webisite and take necessary actions. You can control</p>		<p>anything that is going on in the browser.</p>				<h5>HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)</h5>		<p>This security only allows HTTPS requests on all subsequent request. Enforcing this header highly reduces pissoble</p>		<p>MiTM attacks <code>Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000</code></p>				<h6>Security Sensitive Information</h6>		<p>HTTP Cookies, in <code>secure</code> and <code>HttpOnly</code> mode to make your data more secure.</p>		<p>The <code>secure</code> flag ensures that the browser sends the cookie only over a HTTP connection.</p>		<p>The <code>HttpOnly</code> flag prevents any JavaScript code to read from it.</p>						<h6>Conclusion</h6>		<p>Security it is very important nowadays malicious people are out there and you don't want to take the risk</p>		<p>in losing important data that will ruin your life or the hard work that you put working on that project</p>		<p>it is very important to see every angle and just be very careful with malicious attacks.</p>			</div>		<div class="bottom">		<p>Copyright &copy; 2020 Ernesto L Zanabria, All Rights Reserved.
